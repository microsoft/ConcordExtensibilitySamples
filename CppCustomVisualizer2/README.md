## C/C++ Custom Visualizer
This directory contains an example C/C++ Custom Visualizer.

## What is a Custom Visualizer?
The Visual Studio C/C++ Expression Evaluator allows customization of the display of variables in
the debugger based on the type of that variable (example: change the way CExampleClass variables
are displayed) using .natvis files. Natvis files add rules to format a type either declaratively or
by running custom code in the debugger. This custom code is called a Custom Visualizer. Most of
the time it is easier and much less error prone to use the declarative approach. But
Custom Visualizers are useful when formatting a type is too complicated to be done declaratively.

Natvis documentation can be found on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/create-custom-views-of-native-objects).
